              <h3>SKILLSETS: <span class="bold">HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span></h3>
              <h3>SCOPE: A school group assignment that required an interactive prototype of a website for a hotel that included a content-intensive webpage and an interactive form webpage from each group member.</h3>
              <h3>The groups were given the liberty to select the type of hotel they wished to focus on, and my group's choice was a luxury urban hotel named "Hiwoods Hotel."</h3>
              <h3>The content page that was allocated to me was the "About Us" part of the website.</h3>
              <h3>Click <a href="https://detecller.github.io/ProjectHiwoods.github.io/HTML/About_us.html">here</a> to go to live demo.</h3>

              <h2 class="headline">Project Work and Thought Process</h2>
              <h3>To know the contents of the "About Us" page is to be conscious of the webpage's goal. The purpose of an "About Us" page is to establish the brand identity, as well as build credibility and trust. All to attract, engage and convert visitors of the website to guests of the hotel.</h3>
              <h3>To find the most suitable brand identity for the hotel, I had to step into the customer's shoes and imagine what I enjoy from an urban luxury hotel. Since the hotel is situated in urban areas and is a luxurious one, naturally the hotel would have very high amounts of floors. Customers of such hotels can enjoy the luxurious bird's eye view of the city and the luminous night sky.
              </h3>

              <h3>To mimic the sky-rise view of a hotel, I used a vertical high-quality photo of such a scene. However, it was thought that the photo alone wasn't captivating enough, prompting me to enhance its appeal by incorporating interactivity with JavaScript.</h3>
              <h3>By adding a spinning oval with a half-bright half-dark colour on top of the photo, blurring the oval into the dark background, and making the oval follow the user's cursor with a delay, a mimic of the sky's glow is created. Adding a crucial piece of a luxurious urban hotel, a luxurious view of the night sky.
              <h3>To further establish brand identity and credibility, an auto-scrolling review section and a "Leaders" section have been added below the main fold.</h3>
              <h3>The website can be viewed <a href="https://detecller.github.io/ProjectHiwoods.github.io/HTML/About_us.html">here</a>.</h3>

              <h2>Project Outcome</h2>
              <h3>The integration of interactive design with thoughtful content strategy contributed to an engaging user experience, effectively capturing the essence of Hiwoods Hotel and communicating its offerings to potential guests. 
                <br><br>This project not only fulfilled the assignment's requirements but also provided a valuable lesson for me on the impact of user-focused design in enhancing a webpage for better brand storytelling and engagement. 
                <br><br>It emphasized the benefits of blending technical skills with creative insights in User Experience Design, demonstrating its importance in achieving business objectives and improving user satisfaction.</h3>
                <h3>My mates and I were satisfied with the prototype we have created, receiving commends from others on the unique design.</h3>
